MapQuest
--------
In 1996, MapQuest created the first mapping service which gained popularity in America during the early 2000's. MapQuest introduced the geocoding technology and algorithms that first turned satellite imagery and road map data into searchable, turn-by-turn directions. MapQuest provided an amazingly innovative way to view maps. They quickly determined the fastest destination, they took into account the traffic conditions and they estimated your arrival time with precision. Today, the company continues to refine its routing technology to provide not only the most accurate directions, but also advanced features like maximizing fuel efficiency and viewing real-time traffic cams. 
In the early 2000s, MapQuest was at the top of their game. They likely had the same assumption that most leading corporations have, that they will always be on top of the game. Innovations in the mid 2000 quickly threatened MapQuest's dominance. Google released Google Maps in 2005 and quickly rose to prominence. Google Maps quickly began releasing features that MapQuest just couldn’t compete with. Their resources were much more limited and Googles Maps took charge very quickly
One major distinction between the two was the availability of the products. Google made it a priority to reach the world by making their product available in many different countries whereas MapQuest was only available in the United States. This was a market gap that Google was quick to identify and utilize on. On top of this, Google Maps offered a 3D view, dynamic search results and three additional map types which MapQuest was unable to provide. 
Google provided a much more simple approach to interacting with their mapping system. MapQuest required a minimum of four user inputs to perform a search while google only required one. Google maps maintained a minimal user interface to improve the visual appearance while MapQuest insisted on providing as much information as possible on the maps. Traffic lines and routes for instance were all mashed together and it was difficult to tell the difference. Google Maps was more interactive and “draggable,” which provided a kind of “wow” factor that MapQuest didn’t have. Google also envisioned Maps as a searchable database of locations, which made it more useful than MapQuest, which was mostly about getting driving directions.
MapQuest was unable to provide the proper resources to remain as a key competitor. They were slow to innovate in the early 2000’s and then by the time competitors came out, the competition had greater tech, design, and resources to outshine MapQuest in all areas. Google soon integrated their maps into all smartphones widening the gap for MapQuest to ever take the lead. More competitors like Apple's Mapping Services and Wayz came out and made the gap for MapQuest even larger.
Today MapQuest still exists and claims a remarkable number 38 million users. Google Maps has more than a billion users globally according to the company.

Reasons for failure
-------------------
1. Inability to identify market gaps - MapQuest was unable to exploit the full potential of their product. Perhaps they should have envisioned how they would serve every smartphone user, without limiting their services to a specific region.
2. Lack of resources - MapQuest was not as well funded as the competitors hence the competitors were easily able to develop and adopt new features.
3. Inability to keep up with competitors and the growing and dynamic market trends.

Lessons Learnt
--------------
1. Importance of HCI in design - MapQuest should have focused on the interactiveness and intuitiveness of their product to make it easier to use. 
2. Importance of End User involvement during product design - MapQuest should have conducted surveys or adopted a feedback procedure in order to receive suggestions and reviews from the end users.
