4.2.1. Functional Requirements
	Straight forward statements about the functionalities that the system will deliver. Essentially follow the format “The system should….” Eg the system should allow users to sign up.

4.2.2. Non-Functional/Quality Requirements.
	Paste the ones you have here but make them at least 7. Also make sure you explain them well.

4.2.3. Hardware Requirements
	The hardware you need to develop the application eg A laptop with 4GB of RAM. Also speak of External storage you need and processor speed

4.2.4 Software Requiremnts
	The software you need to develop the application eg: android studio

4.3. System Constraints
	Constraints without which your application can not work. Eg: The Application can not work without internet connection
