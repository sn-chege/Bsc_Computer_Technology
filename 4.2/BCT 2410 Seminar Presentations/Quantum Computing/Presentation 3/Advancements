A grand vision for a Quantum OS

	 Around 50 quantum computers have been built to date, and they all use different software – there is no quantum equivalent of Windows, IOS or Linux. The new project will deliver an OS that allows the same quantum software to run on different types of quantum computing hardware. The system, Deltaflow.OS (full name Deltaflow-on-ARTIQ) has been designed by Cambridge Uni startup "Riverlane".

 Quantum Supremacy by google

 	In 2019, Google’s quantum computer did a calculation in less than four minutes that would take the world’s most powerful computer 10,000 years to do. Google’s Quantum Computer Is About 158 Million Times Faster Than the World’s Fastest Supercomputer. (The moment when quantum computers can do things that are not possible for ordinary computers)
