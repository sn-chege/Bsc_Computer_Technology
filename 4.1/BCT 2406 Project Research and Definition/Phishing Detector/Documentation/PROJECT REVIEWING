Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
------------------------
URL is the abbreviation of Uniform Resource Locator, which is the global address of documents and other resources on the World Wide Web. A URL has two main components : 
(i) Protocol identifier (indicates what protocol to use) e.g. https
(ii) Resource name (specifies the IP address or the domain name where the resource is located). The protocol identifier and the resource name are separated by a colon and two forward slashes e.g. google.com	


There are two major segments of phishing: First, a potential victim receiving a phishing email and the second, where the victim is driving to the spoofed website via a fake email. There could be a chance of including an attachment too to install malware or replying with sensitive information.

Phishing Email 
	Criminals generally use a social technique rather than technical tricks in their phishing emails to fool their end-users. For instance, the conveying urgency is a well-known method used by criminals to misdirect people's attention. In some cases, the criminals pretend to be a system administrator warning people about a new attack and urging them to install the attached path [5].

Spoof website 
	Most phishing attacks try to convince people to go to a fake site where personal information can be collected. To host a fake site, Phisher’s use free web space, use a compromised machine or register a new domain. In most cases, cyber criminals register the domain name similar to the site they want to imitate. For example, Phisher’s might register PayPal site as paypal-login.com. Criminals also use homograph attacks that exploit the visual similarity
