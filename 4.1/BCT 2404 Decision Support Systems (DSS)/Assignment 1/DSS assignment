Q2.Analyze a DSS application in the market. Describe its main components and summarize its functionalities.

Application: TCBWorks

What is TCBWorks?
A first generation web-based groupware system, where individuals can work together to generate ideas, discuss problems, and make decisions whether they are in the same room, or halfway around the world. More than 200 organizations around the world are using the software, either on their server or the main host's server. TCBWorks has been used to support same time and place meetings in decision room settings and where some participants are at remote locations.

Architecture of TCBWorks

TCBWorks uses n-tier architechture with 4 major layers. Each component is separate, thus easy to spread different components on different servers and to partition the application logic on two different servers. When the user first connects to the web server, it presents a login screen that requests the user to enter a user name and password. Once a user has successfully logged on, the user is presented with the Project Screen which screen displays the list all projects to which the user has access. The user can then navigate around the system by selecting projects and going further indepth into their sub-units.

The 4 Major Components include:
1. Presentation layer (Web Browser on client computer) - This is used to interact with the system
2. Application layer (Web Server) - This responds to users requests by providing HTML pages and graphics or by sending request to third componentc. 
3. Application Logic (Set of 38 C programs) - This perform various functions such as adding comments or voting
4. Database Layer (Database Server) - This handles all operations pertaining to data (data access logic, data storage).


Features:
- All of the information in TCBWorks is located in (hierarchical) Projects.
- Many Topics are present in a single Project.
- Comments are paragraphs of user entered remarks.
- TCBWorks also allows voting on Topics.
- Projects, topics, comments, and voting all have a variety of options.
- There are 4 types of users in TCBWorks: 
1. Administrator can perform any function, including creating and deleting users.
2. An Organizer can create new projects and perform any function on the projects he or she creates, including granting access to other users, deleting the project, moving it, etc.
3. A Participant can only access those projects to which they have been granted access by an organizer, and perform those functions permitted by the organizer.
4. Observer has read-only access to the projects specified by an organizer
